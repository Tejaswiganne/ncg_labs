## Domain Service for Accounts

Test-first, implement and `AccountService` with:

* `void withdraw(Account account, int amount)`
  * validate that account balance is greater than the amount
  * if not, throw `IllegalArgumentException`
  * Examples:
    * withdraw(a, 10) where `a` has balance of $10 will **fail**
    * withdraw(a, 20) where `a` has balance of $21 will **succeed**

* `void transfer(Account source, Account target, int amount)`
  * validate that source's balance > amount
  * if not, throw `IllegalArgumentException`
  * Examples:
    * transfer(a, b, 10) where `a` has balance of $10 will **fail**
    * transfer(a, b, 20) where `a` has balance of $21 will **succeed** 

Use the AssertJ mechanism for checking for exceptions instead of the JUnit way of doing it.

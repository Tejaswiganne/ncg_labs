Note

Apparently the first-class flight attendant's bags don't have a special place, so they take away space from paying passengers instead of using space that's available in -- first class.
So, instead of me being able to put my bag above my seat (for which I paid extra), I had to put it 4 rows back, fighting the crowd upstream.
And he was a bit rude, as well.
Thanks Virgin/Alaska.

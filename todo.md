# To Do's

* DONE- Update all document references to ensure they point to the latest Spring/Spring Boot releases

* DONE- Update all github references (e.g., https://github.com/ted-ncg) to point to current project

* DONE- Create (or update) short link to the first couple of labs

* Update examples for Thymeleaf

* Tests for Thymeleaf (esp. the URL interpolation)?

Implementing equals, hashCode, and toString()

esp. for failing tests like:

```
java.lang.AssertionError: 
Expecting:
 <[]>
to contain:
 <[com.visa.ncg.canteen.Account@215be6bb, com.visa.ncg.canteen.Account@4439f31e]>
but could not find:
 <[com.visa.ncg.canteen.Account@215be6bb, com.visa.ncg.canteen.Account@4439f31e]>
```

## Labs

* Remote API: use https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ as another example

* Transfer Service: Add bonus to extract class to an interface and use Spring's config annotations to select implementation


## Slides

* JavaBean (differentiate from POJO?)

* Dependency injection

* HTTP Sequence diagrams


## Posters

* TDD cycle
